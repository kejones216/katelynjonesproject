    <h2>A little about Katelyn... </h2>
    <p>
      Katelyn Jones was born and raised just outside Detroit, Michigan. As a creative young girl, she leared how to play the piano. She loved to sing in her basement to her favorite pop tunes. Formally a gymnast, this little girl needed a new creative outlet. She starting to sing a dance around the age of eleven, and has since never stopped!

She's a skilled performance hula hooper, able to do advance tricks and combos with various dance props like a hula hoop, silk streamers, and poi. In her spare time, you can catch her painting, and dancing with her hula hoop outside!
